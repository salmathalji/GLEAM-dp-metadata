Metadata in GLEAM DP are expressed in a `datapackage.json` file. It follows the [Data Package](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/#specification) specifications and includes generic **Data Package properties** and specific **GLEAM DP properties**. Properties indicated with `*` are required (i.e. cannot be empty). Additional metadata are organized as four related json resources: `study`, `participant`, `device`, and `dataset`
